cd fyrex-dex
npm install
npm start
```

Your DEX will be running at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🔧 Customization Guide

### 1. Branding
Edit these files to customize your brand:
- **Logo**: Replace the Zap icon in `App.js` line 50
- **Name**: Change "FYREX" to your project name
- **Colors**: Modify the orange/red gradient classes throughout
- **Theme**: Update Tailwind classes for different color schemes

### 2. Add Your Tokens
Update the `tokens` object in `App.js`:
```javascript
const tokens = {
  BSC: [
    { symbol: 'YOUR_TOKEN', name: 'Your Token Name', balance: '0.00' },
    // Add more tokens here
  ],
  // Add more chains
};
```

### 3. Network Configuration
Add/modify networks in the `networks` array:
```javascript
const networks = ['BSC', 'Ethereum', 'YourChain'];
```

## 💡 Integration Guide

### Smart Contract Integration
This template provides the UI framework. You need to:

1. **Replace Mock Functions**: The `connectWallet()`, `calculateOutput()`, and swap functions are placeholder/mock implementations
2. **Add Web3 Provider**: Integrate ethers.js or web3.js for real blockchain interaction
3. **Smart Contract Calls**: Connect to your DEX smart contracts for actual trading
4. **Price Feeds**: Integrate real price oracles (Chainlink, DEX APIs, etc.)

### Adding Liquidity Pools
You'll need to:
- Deploy your own AMM contracts OR
- Integrate with existing DEXs (PancakeSwap, Uniswap, etc.) OR
- Use DEX aggregators for liquidity

### Example Web3 Integration Points:
```javascript
// Replace these mock functions with real implementations:
const connectWallet = async () => {
  // Your wallet connection logic
};

const calculateOutput = (input) => {
  // Your price calculation logic
};

const executeSwap = async () => {
  // Your swap transaction logic
};
```

## 🌐 Deployment Options

npm install --save-dev gh-pages
npm run build
npm run deploy
```
